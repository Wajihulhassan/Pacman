PacMan:

Don't let the name fool you this isn't your normal PacMan.
In this version ghosts have no pattern of movement to follow
so don't bother trying to figure out where they are going next.
Second, you can't get rid of the ghosts even if you eat a 
power pellet instead all that does is make you invisible to
the ghosts. Third the ghosts also reprint the food so now 
you have to try and remember what you've already eaten.
Last, you have only one life so good luck you'll need it.
